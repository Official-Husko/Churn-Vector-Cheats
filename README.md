# Churn Vector Cheats Mod

This mod is a collection of cheats for Churn Vector. Its based on the cheats mod by [Sooba](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Soobas).  
Rewritten to use BepInEx since that doesn't break as easily after updates like MelonLoader.  
***NOW WITH A GUI***

### ***There is currently a known bug with the mouse cursor missing [#2](https://github.com/Official-Husko/Churn-Vector-Cheats/issues/2).***
